         trial had three phases: titration (weeks 0 to 24), maintenance (weeks 25 to 48), and observation \
         (weeks 49 to 72). The original purpose of this was to check the efficacy effects of these medications \

st.subheader("Processed Data")
st.write("For our research, we have only selected the data on week 48 as at that time, almost all patients \
    were not on any medication as per the researchers who originally collected the data. The first step was to \
    transform the raw dataset to have columns representing gene IDs and rows representing sample IDs. \
    The next step was to filter the samples based on the week in which they were collected. For that, we \
    combined data from the metadata file and the raw data file and extracted week 48â€™s data. The next step \
        was to filter out the gene IDs that have very small count after normalization as these will not help \
        in the prediction. We set up a threshold of 5, meaning if the count is under 5, we removed that \
        gene ID. We also removed genes that have a constant count across all samples as these do not \
        contribute to out analysis. To accomplish this, we checked columns with zero standard deviation \
        and removed those columns. Before performing this filtration, we had 62,754 gene IDs. This \
        number became 26,707 gene IDs after filtration. A sample of the processed dataset is shown below.")
