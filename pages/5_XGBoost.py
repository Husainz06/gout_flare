         highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning \
         algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a \
         parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science \
         problems in a fast and accurate way.[10] Below are the results we got from the XGBoost model.")
